# About

This is a template for c++ in Windows.

I use the tool chains below:

- CMake
- pwsh7
- Neovim
- clangd

Notice that, you should replace the line in the `.clangd` file below to your own include path of this project,

```
"-IC:\\EDisk\\CppCodes\\CodeTemplates\\WinCppTemplate\\includes", # you should replace this to your own include path of this project
```

Then, have fun writting c++ in Windows.


Just a test.
